# Crafting-Dropping-Inventory-System

-- Intro --

This project details the scripts for my up - coming game that includes an advanced crafting, dropping and inventory system. It is all coded in C# ! 

-- Setup --

1. Make your UI and panels and game objects then link the codes to the objects making sure to classify the scripts into folders to make it neat
2. Don't forget to add a folder for the actual items and props themselves as well as a chest and it's opening animation for it to tween and work
3. You can test it and that's the end
